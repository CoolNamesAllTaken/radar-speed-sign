"""
Control of WS2812 / NeoPixel LEDs.

MicroPython module: https://docs.micropython.org/en/v1.21.0/library/neopixel.html

This module provides a driver for WS2818 / NeoPixel LEDs.

``Note:`` This module is only included by default on the ESP8266, ESP32 and RP2
   ports. On STM32 / Pyboard and others, you can either install the
   ``neopixel`` package using :term:`mip`, or you can download the module
   directly from :term:`micropython-lib` and copy it to the filesystem.
