   :synopsis: functions related to the hardware



   The ``machine`` module contains specific functions related to the hardware
   on a particular board. Most functions in this module allow to achieve direct
   and unrestricted access to and control of hardware blocks on a system
   (like CPU, timers, buses, etc.). Used incorrectly, this can lead to
   malfunction, lockups, crashes of your board, and in extreme cases, hardware
   damage.

   .. _machine_callbacks:

   A note of callbacks used by functions and class methods of :mod:`machine` module:
   all these callbacks should be considered as executing in an interrupt context.
   This is true for both physical devices with IDs >= 0 and "virtual" devices
   with negative IDs like -1 (these "virtual" devices are still thin shims on
   top of real hardware and real hardware interrupts). See :ref:`isr_rules`.

        Access the pin peripheral (GPIO pin) associated with the given id. If additional arguments are
        given in the constructor then they are used to initialise the pin. Any settings that are not
        specified will remain in their previous state.

The arguments are:

- `id` is mandatory and can be an arbitrary object. Among possible value types are: int
(an internal Pin identifier), str (a Pin name), and tuple (pair of [port, pin]).
- `mode` specifies the pin mode, which can be one of:
    - `Pin.IN` - Pin is configured for input. If viewed as an output the pin is in high-impedance state.
    - `Pin.OUT` - Pin is configured for (normal) output.
    - `Pin.OPEN_DRAIN` - Pin is configured for open-drain output. Open-drain output works in the
    following way: if the output value is set to 0 the pin is active at a low level; if the output
    value is 1 the pin is in a high-impedance state. Not all ports implement this mode, or some might only on certain pins.
    - `Pin.ALT` - Pin is configured to perform an alternative function, which is port specific. For
    a pin configured in such a way any other Pin methods (except Pin.init()) are not applicable
    (calling them will lead to undefined, or a hardware-specific, result). Not all ports implement this mode.
    - `Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN` - The Same as `Pin.ALT`, but the pin is configured as open-drain. Not all
    ports implement this mode.
    - `Pin.ANALOG` - Pin is configured for analog input, see the ADC class.
- `pull` specifies if the pin has a (weak) pull resistor attached, and can be one of:
    - `None` - No pull up or down resistor.
    - `Pin.PULL_UP` - Pull up resistor enabled.
    - `Pin.PULL_DOWN` - Pull down resistor enabled.
- `value` is valid only for `Pin.OUT` and `Pin.OPEN_DRAIN` modes and specifies initial output pin value if
given, otherwise the state of the pin peripheral remains unchanged.
- `drive` specifies the output power of the pin and can be one of: `Pin.DRIVE_0`, `Pin.DRIVE_1`, etc.,
increasing in drive strength. The actual current driving capabilities are port dependent. Not all ports implement this argument.
- `alt` specifies an alternate function for the pin and the values it can take are port dependent. This
argument is valid only for `Pin.ALT` and `Pin.ALT_OPEN_DRAIN` modes. It may be used when a pin supports
more than one alternate function. If only one pin alternate function is supported the this argument is
not required. Not all ports implement this argument.

As specified above, the Pin class allows to set an alternate function for a particular pin, but it does not specify any
further operations on such a pin. Pins configured in alternate-function mode are usually not used as GPIO but are instead
driven by other hardware peripherals. The only operation supported on such a pin is re-initialising, by calling the
constructor or `Pin.init()` method. If a pin that is configured in alternate-function mode is re-initialised
with `Pin.IN`, `Pin.OUT`, or `Pin.OPEN_DRAIN`, the alternate function will be removed from the pin.
