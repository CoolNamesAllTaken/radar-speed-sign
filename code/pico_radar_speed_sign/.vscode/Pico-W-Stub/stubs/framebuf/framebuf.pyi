    The FrameBuffer class provides a pixel buffer which can be drawn upon with
    pixels, lines, rectangles, text and even other FrameBuffer's. It is useful
    when generating output for displays.

    For example::

        import framebuf

        # FrameBuffer needs 2 bytes for every RGB565 pixel
        fbuf = FrameBuffer(bytearray(10 * 100 * 2), 10, 100, framebuf.RGB565)

        Construct a FrameBuffer object.  The parameters are:

            - *buffer* is an object with a buffer protocol which must be large
              enough to contain every pixel defined by the width, height and
              format of the FrameBuffer.
            - *width* is the width of the FrameBuffer in pixels
            - *height* is the height of the FrameBuffer in pixels
            - *format* specifies the type of pixel used in the FrameBuffer;
              permissible values are listed under Constants below. These set the
              number of bits used to encode a color value and the layout of these
              bits in *buffer*.
              Where a color value c is passed to a method, c is a small integer
              with an encoding that is dependent on the format of the FrameBuffer.
            - *stride* is the number of pixels between each horizontal line
              of pixels in the FrameBuffer. This defaults to *width* but may
              need adjustments when implementing a FrameBuffer within another
              larger FrameBuffer or screen. The *buffer* size must accommodate
              an increased step size.

        One must specify valid *buffer*, *width*, *height*, *format* and
        optionally *stride*.  Invalid *buffer* size or dimensions may lead to
        unexpected errors.
