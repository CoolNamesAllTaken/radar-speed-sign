    Return ``fmod(x, y)``, as defined by the platform C library. Note that the

    the C standard is that ``fmod(x, y)`` be exactly (mathematically; to infinite 
    precision) equal to ``x - n*y`` for some integer ``n`` such that the result has 
    the same sign as x and magnitude less than ``abs(y)``. Python’s ``x % y`` returns 
    a result with the sign of ``y`` instead, and may not be exactly computable 
    for float arguments. For example, ``fmod(-1e-100, 1e100)`` is ``-1e-100``, but 
    the result of Python’s ``-1e-100 % 1e100`` is ``1e100-1e-100``, which cannot be 
    represented exactly as a float, and rounds to the surprising ``1e100``. For 
    this reason, function ``fmod()`` is generally preferred when working with 
    floats, while Python’s ``x % y`` is preferred when working with integers.

    Return ``True`` if the values ``a`` and ``b`` are close to each other and ``False`` otherwise.

    Whether or not two values are considered close is determined according to given 
    absolute and relative tolerances.

    ``rel_tol`` is the relative tolerance – it is the maximum allowed difference between 
    ``a`` and ``b``, relative to the larger absolute value of ``a`` or ``b``. For example, to set a 
    tolerance of 5%, pass ``rel_tol=0.05``. The default tolerance is ``1e-09``, which assures 
    that the two values are the same within about 9 decimal digits. ``rel_tol`` must be 
    greater than zero.

    ``abs_tol`` is the minimum absolute tolerance – useful for comparisons near zero. 
    ``abs_tol`` must be at least zero.

    If no errors occur, the result will be: ``abs(a-b) <= max(rel_tol * max(abs(a), abs(b)), abs_tol)``.

    The IEEE 754 special values of ``NaN``, ``inf``, and ``-inf`` will be handled according to IEEE rules. 
    Specifically, ``NaN`` is not considered close to any other value, including ``NaN``. ``inf`` and
    ``-inf`` are only considered close to themselves.
